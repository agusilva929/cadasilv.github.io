In 1671, the famed astronomer Giovanni Cassini was observing Saturn when he found a new, faint moon orbiting it along its western side. As he attempted to follow its orbit, however, he found something incredibly unusual: the moon was completely invisible when it ought to have been along Saturn’s eastern side. The next year, he followed up by searching for the moon again, and again he was able to observe it on Saturn’s western side, but not the eastern one. After more than three decades of improvements to the telescope, Cassini was finally able to find this moon on both the western and eastern sides in 1705, but found that it appeared more than six times fainter on the eastern side.<br><HR>

Cassini developed a theory about this moon, now known as Iapetus. He contended that first off, Iapetus must be two-toned, with one side significantly lighter and brighter than the other, darker side, and that secondly, it must be tidally locked to Saturn, so that the same side always faces it. Put this together and the “leading edge” of Iapetus would have to be significantly fainter and darker than the trailing edge. If, that is, Cassini was right.


It took more than 300 years before the Cassini space probe would make it to Saturn and observe Iapetus up close, something that didn’t happen until 2007. When it finally make it there, what it found was nothing short of spectacular.

Iapetus was very much two-toned, with one hemisphere a factor of ten-to-twenty times more reflective than the other. The situation was even more severe than Cassini himself had ever imagined, as the delineation between light-and-dark hemispheres doesn’t perfectly coincide with Iapetus’ orbit.

But this led to an even greater mystery: why would Iapetus appear this way?


Iapetus, you see, is the outermost large moon of Saturn, orbiting twice as far out as any of Saturn’s other moons. What appears to be some type of dark debris that collected on the leading side — an effect similar to “bugs on a windshield” — would be an awfully bizarre explanation, since it’s well outside of the other major players in Saturn’s system, including Saturn’s rings. In fact, none of Saturn’s other moons display this feature; Iapetus is alone. Yet the culprit was about to be caught.

Even outer to Iapetus lies Phoebe, a smaller moon that’s most likely a captured object from the Kuiper belt. Unlike all of Saturn’s other moons, Phoebe orbits in the opposite direction, is far more distant, and most importantly, is very, very dark. In addition, Phoebe has been emitting a steady stream of particles for a very long time, as the Sun’s radiation and minor collisions are strong enough to kick dust grains off of Phoebe’s loosely-held-together surface.



Thanks to infrared observatories like the Spitzer Space Telescope, we’ve been able to discover something incredible about Phoebe: it’s created its own ring around Saturn, larger, more diffuse and far less dense than any other ring discovered so far.

The ring is so dramatically sparse — at seven dust-sized grains per cubic kilometers — and so huge in extent that even distant Iapetus plows through it in its orbit! Phoebe and its ring particles revolve clockwise around Saturn, but Iapetus goes counterclockwise, meaning that we do get the “bugs on a windshield” effect.

Over time, these much darker particles accumulate on one side of Iapetus and not the other, but that’s only the start of the story. If that were the full story, the “bright stuff” on Iapetus, which is ice, would simply cover over the darkened Phoebe material, and Iapetus would appear entirely white.

But the same physics that causes a black car left in the Sun to be much hotter to the touch than a white car in the same conditions is at play on Iapetus, too. When this water attempts to condense, freeze and settle onto the light regions on Iapetus, there’s nothing stopping it. But when it lands on the dark regions, the heat from the surface is enough to sublimate (boil, directly from a solid phase) the ice, rendering it capable of landing stably and permanently only on the size that isn’t covered in Phoebe’s debris.

The result? A two-toned, Yin-Yang world unlike any other in the Solar System. After more than 300 years, this is one puzzle of the Solar System that’s finally solved. The most unusual looking moon has a dark side, all thanks to a failed comet that was captured by Saturn long ago. Over hundreds of millions of years (or more), its debris built up on this lonely, outer moon, changing its color and how it absorbs sunlight. With no ice able to remain on that side, it was destined for darkness, and the rest is history!
