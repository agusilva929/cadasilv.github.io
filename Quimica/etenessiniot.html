<h3> Tennessine One Hundred seventeenth element of the Periodic Table </h3>

</div> <div align = "left">

<B>
Tennessine is an artificially produced radioactive element about which little is known. It is expected to be solid, but its classification is unknown. It is a member of the halogen group.
<p>
Element # 117 of the Periodic Table of Elements had already been designated ununseptium, a placeholder name meaning one-one-seven in Latin. In November 2016, the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) approved the tennessine name for element 117.
</p> <p>
IUPAC also approved names for elements 113 (nihonium, with atomic symbol Nh), 115 (moscovium, Mc) and 118 (oganesson, Og).
</p> <p>
Element names 115 and 117 were proposed by their discoverers at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna, Russia; the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee; Vanderbilt University, Tennessee; and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, California. Both the names of elements, moscovium and tennessine, honor the regions where experiments linked to the creation of the elements took place.
Just the facts
</p> <ul>
<li> Atomic Number: 117 </li>
<li> Atomic Symbol: Ts </li>
<li> Atomic Weight: [294] </li>
<li> Melting Point: Unknown </li>
<li> Boiling Point: Unknown </li> </ul>
<h3> Discovery </h3>

<p> Element 117 was discovered in 2010 and jointly announced on April 5 of that year by scientists at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna, Russia, and scientists at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California.
</p> <h3> tennessine properties </h3>

<p> Tennessine has two isotopes with known half lives and two with unknown half lives. The most stable isotope is 294T, with a half-life of about 80 milliseconds. It decays by alpha decay. Tennessine's other isotopes are suspected of decaying by alpha decay and spontaneous fission.
</p> <p>
The atomic weight of artificial transuran elements is based on the longest lived isotope. These atomic weights should be considered provisional since a new isotope with a longer half life could be produced in the future. [See Periodic Table of Elements]
</p> <h3> Tennessine Fonts </h3>
<p>
Scientists who created tennessine bombarded berkelium atoms with calcium ions until tennessine atoms were produced.
</p> <h3> Uses of tennessine </h3>

Since only a few tennessine atoms have been made, it has no practical uses outside of scientific study.
