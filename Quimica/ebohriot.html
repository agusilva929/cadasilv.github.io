Bohrio (named after Niels Bohr) or Eka-Rhenium (properties probably similar to those of rhenium) is a synthetic chemical element, symbol Bh, atomic number 107 (107 protons and 107 electrons) that has atomic mass [264] u.
<HR>
It is a transitional element, belonging to group 7 of the periodic table, radioactive, transuranic, probably metallic, solid, silver in appearance, whose most stable isotope, Bh-262, has a half-life of 102 minutes.
<HR>
The bohrio-261 isotope was synthesized in 1976 by Soviet scientists in Dubna, bombarding bismuth with heavy chromium ions. Out of scientific research no use is known for boho.

History: <BR>

Boho was synthesized in 1976 by a team of Soviet scientists led by Y. Oganessian at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna, Russia, who produced the 261Bh isotope with a half-life of 1-2 minutes (according to other sources in around 10 minutes).

This team synthesized the Bh-261 isotope by bombarding bismuth-204 with heavy chromium-54 nuclei.
<HR>
In 1981 a German team led by Peter Armbruster and Gottfried Münzenberg at the "Gesellschaft für Schwerionenforschung" of the "Institute for Heavy Ion Research" in Darmstadt confirmed the results of Soviet research, but obtained the isotope Bh-262.
<HR>
The Germans suggested that the new element should be named after the Danish physicist Niels Bohr; however, the Soviets suggested that the name of the physicist should be given to element 105 (dbn).
<HR>
Due to the controversy over the naming of elements 101 to 109, IUPAC provisionally named this element "unnilseptium" (symbol Uns).

In 1994 an IUPAC committee recommended that element 107 be termed “bohrio” with “Bh” symbol. The name was recognized internationally in 1997.
