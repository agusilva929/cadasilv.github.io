<h3> Darmstadtium One hundred tenth element of the Periodic Table </h3>

</div> <div align = "left">

<B> cal element of atomic number 110 (110 protons and 110 electrons). Its most stable atomic nucleus has atomic mass [281] u. It belongs to group 10 of the Periodic Classification of Elements. It is probably a metallic solid.
<HR>
History: <BR>

The isotope Ds-269 was discovered by Professor S. Hofmann and his collaborators on November 9, 1994, through the soft fusion (low heat) of Pb-208 with Ni-62 with the emission of a neutron at the Research Institute. Heavy Ions (GSI - Gesellschaft für Schwerionenforschung) from Darmstadt, Germany, winning the heavy metals race by competing with Berkeley (United States) and Dubna (Russia).

On November 23, 1994, similarly, but using the fusion Ni-64 was created the isotope Ds-271, with two more neutrons than Ds-269.
<HR>
Nomenclature: <BR>
Provisional Names: <BR>

Prior to its discovery the 110-element was predicted in the periodic table by Dmitri Mendeleiev and called Eka-Platinum - like all theoretical elements of the time: it was named after the element above the previous period (in this case Platinum), preceded by the prefix " eka- "(from Sanskrit." one ").
After its discovery it was provisionally called "Ununnilium" by IUPAC (Systematic Name).
<HR> Definitive name and translation: <BR>

Finally, in August 2003, the commission established the name "Darmstadtium" (symbol Ds), as claimed by its discoverers, named after the city of Darmstadt, where the element was first synthesized. The name was translated Darmstácio into Portuguese. The translations "Darmestadium" or "Darmestadium" were also considered, but the current name prevailed for phonetic reasons.
