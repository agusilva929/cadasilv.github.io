<h3>Livermorium one hundred and sixteenth periodic table element</h3>

In 1999, researchers at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory announced the discovery element 116, in an article published in the American Physical Review Letters, explaining the decay α of an atom of higher atomic number. The following year, they published a retraction after they could not get the element back in the laboratory.  In June 2002, the laboratory director announced that the experimental data were distorted by author Victor Ninov.

In June 2000, the Joint Nuclear Research Institute in the city of Dubna (Russia) conducted studies describing the α-decay of the 292F1 isotope that was the product of the fusion reaction of a 248Cm nucleus when bombarded with accelerated 48 Ca by a cyclotron, obtaining as by-product 4 neutrons. It has a half-life of about 6 thousandths of a second (0.006 seconds). After that, there is a decay α in 288Fl - (Flerovium) -, followed by two more atoms of smaller atomic number to later have a spontaneous fission.

New experiments were done between late 2000 and early 2001, but these failed to replicate the atom.
<HR>
In October 2006 it was announced that three times bombarding Californium-249 atoms with calcium-48 ions produced ununoctium (element 118), which then decayed to live in milliseconds. Confirmed this, the synthesis of element 116 had then been demonstrated conclusively.
<HR>
Due to its instability, reduced half-life and difficulty of collection, there are no industrial or commercial applications for this element and its implementation is relegated only to scientific research.
<HR> Definitive name: <BR>

Ununhexium was a temporary name recommended by IUPAC for element 116. Some scientists at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research had proposed the name "Flyorovium" for this element - in honor of G. N. Flyorov, group leader who synthesized elements 102 to 110.
<HR>
On December 8, 2011, the Division of Inorganic Chemistry of IUPAC confirmed the name and symbol of this element. The definitive name chosen was livermorium (Lv), in reference to the National Laboratory of the city of Livermore, California.38 Thus, following accession to the periodic table, the names liverium and flerobus (element 114, formerly called ununchadium) were approved and announced on May 31, 2012 by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry.
