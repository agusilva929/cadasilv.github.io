<h3>Einsteinium ninety ninth Periodic table element</h3>

<HR> History: <BR>
The element was named from the physicist Albert Einstein.

The einsteinium was first identified in December 1952 by Albert Ghiorso at the University of California, Berkeley, and another team led by G.R. Choppin at the Los Alamos National Laboratory. Both examined residues from the first hydrogen bomb test that generated 10.4 megatons performed on November 1, 1952 at Enewetak Atoll, Ivy Mike (Ivy Operation). Initially they found a new plutonium isotope, the Pu-244, exams showed that the production of this isotope is only possible through the absorption of 6 neutrons per uranium-238 atoms forming Uranium-244 which would then suffer two beta decays  forming netunio- 244 to then form plutonium-244. At the time it was thought that the multiple absorption of neutrons (process r) was a very rare process. But the existence of Pu-244 showed that uranium could absorb even more neutrons and create elements heavier than the Californium.

Subsequently the team received new samples of the air and radioactive precipitation and in addition to coral debris from the atoll affected by the detonation. Using paper filters with radioactive debris dissolved in a presence of nitric acid-ammonia buffer solution in an acid fraction medium with pH ~ 3.5 (same technique used to detect Pu-244) at elevated temperatures in ion exchange medium were identified less of 200 einsteinium-253 atoms whose identification was only possible due to its high energy released by its alpha decay that releases 6.6 MeV.
<HR>
The creation of 253-99Es in the midst of nuclear detonation occurred due to 15 neutron catches by U-238 atoms succeeded by seven successive beta decays. In addition it was later discovered that some U-238 atoms were able to absorb 17 neutrons instead of 15, and passing through the same seven decayed beta formed another isotope of einsteinium, the 255-99Es. In addition these Es-255 atoms underwent a beta decay and created the first samples of the next element, the number 100: fermium.
<HR>
    
Meanwhile new isotopes of Einsteinium and Fermium began to be produced in the Berkeley and Argonne laboratories using nuclear reactions between nitrogen-14 and uranium-238 that soon absorbed neutrons created by the intense decay of atoms of plutonium or californium.

In 1961, a macroscopic amount of Es-253 was synthesized. This sample weighed approximately 0.01 mg and was measured using a special balance. The material produced was used to produce the mendelevium. The larger amount of einsteinium was produced at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in a "High Flux Isotope Reactor," in Tennessee, bombarding plutonium-239 with neutrons. 3 mg of einsteinium were produced in this program, which lasted 4 years, from 1 kg of plutonium10 11.

Main features: <BR>

Einsteinium is a solid, silver, highly radioactive, artificially produced metal. Studies of Es-253 samples demonstrate that this element exhibits chemical properties typical of a heavy trivalent metal. In the periodic table is located the right of the californium and the left of the fermium with atomic numbers 98 and 100 respectively and below the holmium lanthanide, element with which it shares many characteristics in common. Its density is 8.84 g / cm³, lower than that of californium (15.1 g / cm³) and almost equal to holmium (8.79 g / cm³). Although it has a much larger atomic mass than its similar one, holmium, the einsteinium's melting point is low, only 860 ° C, lower than that of californium (900 ° C), fermium (1527 ° C) and of holmium (1461 ° C) .1 2
<HR>
Unlike the milder actinides such as californium, berkelium, curium, and americium that crystallized into double hexagonal structures when under ambient conditions, it is believed that the einstenium crystallizes in a cube of faces centered (acronym in English: fcc) with the spatial group Fm \ bar {3} m with each crystal having area equal to 576 pm. However, there are reports that by heating einsteinium crystals at 300 ° C hexagonal crystals were formed as in most other actinides which, after returning to room temperature, continued with the format.
<HR>
However the radioactivity of the einsteinium is so intense that it usually destroys the crystal quickly. Each gram of 253Es produces 1 000 watts of energy per gram releasing an intense visible light. This intense radioactivity was responsible for the identification of its first samples. This feature should contribute to the low density and melting point of this element. In addition, due to the difficulty in obtaining data from their characteristics obtained from the observation of small samples using electron microscopes, these small quantities used may end up warming up faster and therefore generate data at times that are erroneous.
<HR>
The metal is divalent and has a remarkably high volatility. In order to reduce damage by auto-radiation, most of the einsteinium samples and their compounds receive the measurements soon after the heat treatment and some are even studied on atmospheres of reducing gases like H2O + HCl to study EsOCl.67 8
<HR>
In addition to its self-destruction of crystals and chemical structures of einsteinium and its compounds other major intrinsic difficulties in the study of einsteinium is in its availability, being produced only 1 or 2 times per year in amounts of subgrams and the contamination of samples arising from the rapid conversion of einsteinium to berkelium and then to californium.
<HR>    
So most of the data on einsteinium are deduced or not very accurate.

Chemistry
<br>
Like all actinides, einsteinium is quite reactive. Its trivalent oxidation state is more stable in aqueous solution and solids where it assumes a pale pink color. The existence of divalent einsteinium is firmly established, especially in the solid phase; the second oxidation state as such is not observed in many other actinides, including protactinium, uranium, neptunium, plutonium, curium, and berkelium. Einsteinium compounds of this type can be obtained, for example, by reduction of einsteinium (III) with samarium (II) chloride. The +4 oxidation state was postulated from steam studies and is still uncertain.
