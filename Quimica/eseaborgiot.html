 <B>

 Seaborgium (named after Glenn T. Seaborg) or Eka-Tungsten (chemical behavior probably similar to tungsten) is a synthetic chemical element, symbol Sg, atomic number 106 (106 protons and 106 electrons) with atomic mass [266] u.  It is a transition metal belonging to group 6 of the periodic classification of elements.
 <HR>
 It is a radioactive, transuranic element, probably metallic, solid silver in appearance.  The element was synthesized in 1974 by a Soviet team in Dubna and an American team in Berkeley.  The most stable isotope is the 266Sg with a half life of 21 seconds.  No use is known outside the scope of research.

 History: <BR>

 Element 106 was discovered simultaneously in two laboratories.  In June 1974, a Soviet team led by G. N. Flerov at the "Joint Institute for Nuclear Research" in Dubna reported the production of the 259-mass seaborgium isotope (0.48 second half-life) by bombarding lead isotopes with Cr-54 ions.  In September 1974, an American team led by Albert Ghiorso at the "Lawrence Radiation Laboratory" at the University of California, Berkeley, reported the creation of a 263 (1 second half-life) mass isotope bombarding Cf-249 isotopes.  with ions of O-18.
 <HR>
 The Americans suggested the name "seaborgium" after the American chemist and physicist Glenn T. Seaborg.  Controversy was created because the honoree was still alive.  IUPAC decided to adopt the temporary name "unnilhexium" (Unh symbol).
 <HR>
 An international committee decided in 1992 that the Berkely and Dubna labs would take credit for the discovery.
 <HR>
 In 1994 IUPAC recommended for element 106 the name Rutherforium adopting the rule that no element can be named after a living person.  This rule was fiercely criticized by the American Chemical Society, claiming that a precedent had already occurred when an einstein element was named after Albert Einstein while alive.  In 1997, as part of an agreement involving elements 104 and 108, the name "seaborgium", symbol "Sg", was internationally recognized.
 <HR> Isotopes: <BR>

 11 seaborgium isotopes are known, the longest-lived isotope 269Sg, whose mode of decay occurs through alpha emission and spontaneous fission.  It has a half life of 22 seconds.  The shortest-lived is 258Sg isotope with alpha decay and spontaneous fission.  The half-life of this isotope is only 2.9 milliseconds.
