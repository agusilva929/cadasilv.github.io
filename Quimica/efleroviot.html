<h3> Flerovium One Hundred fourteenth element of the Periodic Table </h3>

<B>
Flerovium3 is a synthetic chemical element, symbol Fl, atomic number 114 (114 protons and 114 electrons), of atomic mass [289] u, belonging to group 14 or IVA of the periodic table. The name was officially adopted by IUPAC on 31 May 2012.4
<HR>
It is a transuranic, radioactive element, probably metallic, solid and silver in appearance. It was synthesized by a team of Russian scientists from the Russian city (Dubna), in 1999. Along with the ununpenium is part of the so-called "island of stability", whose chemical elements should theoretically be more stable than those around them.
<HR>
History: <BR>

In January 1999, the synthesis of element 114 (ununquadium) was reported informally by scientists at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna, Russia. The same team reproduced the synthesis of this element three months later.
<HR>
Flerovium can be obtained in particle accelerators by bombarding plutonium-244 with calcium ions. This has only been done twice, resulting in the isotopes Fl-289 and Fl-288.
<HR>
Substances have not yet been prepared using flerovium, but the chemical and physical properties are assumed to be similar to those of lead compounds: flerovium would be a relatively dense, solid (low melting) metal, relatively oxidized. 2 and +4 (+2 would be more stable). The respective sulfate and chloride in the +2 state would be poorly soluble in water, as would PbCl2 and PbSO4.
<HR> Permanent Name: <BR>

"Ununquadium" was a systematic, temporary name adopted by IUPAC for element 114. Some researchers call it "eka-lead", conjecturing that its properties are similar to those of lead.
<HR>
The element was recognized by IUPAC in June 2011.5 On December 5, 2011, Ununquadium and Unun-hexium were renamed by IUPAC's Inorganic Chemistry Division: Flerovium (Fl) and Livermorio (Lv), respectively. The name Flerovium was given in honor of the founder of Russia's Flerov Laboratory, nuclear physicist Georgy Flyorov (1913-1990). 6 Thus, after adhering to the periodic table, these names were definitively approved and announced on May 31, 2012 by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry.
