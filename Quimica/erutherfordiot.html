 </div> <div align = "left">

 <B>
 Rutherfordium (Eka-Hafnium) Presents chemical symbol 'Rf' with [atomic number] 104 (104 protons and 104 electrons).

 This element is highly radioactive, with most of its isotopes with half-lives below 70 seconds.  Consequently, this element has no known application and little is known about it.  The element is the first transactinide and is expected to have similar chemical properties to the hafnium element.

 History: <BR>

 The rutherford (named after New Zealand physicist and chemist Ernest Rutherford) was documented as the first synthetic element produced by the "Dubna Nuclear Research Institute" (USSR) in 1964. These researchers, led by GN Flevor, bombed  plutonium-242 with neon-22 ions, detecting an isotope which has been suggested to be element 104 of mass number 260.
 <HR>
 In 1969, researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, synthesized the element by bombarding California-249 with carbon-12.  The University of California group of researchers also reported that they failed to reproduce the synthesis previously made by Soviet scientists.
 <HR>
 The result of this has generated controversy.  The Soviets named the Kurchatovian element 104, symbol Ku, in honor of Russian Igor Kurchatov (1903-1960), former head of Soviet nuclear research.  In 1969, Albert Ghiorso, a member of the North American team, suggested the name Ruhterfordium.  In 1994, IUPAC proposed the dubious name (now element 105) in honor of the first place it was discovered (Dubna).
 <HR>
 The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) adopted "Unnilquadio" (Unq) as a provisional name for this element until, finally, in 1997, it named for element 104 the name rutherford (Rf) named after nuclear physicist Ernest Rutherford.  (1871–1937).
