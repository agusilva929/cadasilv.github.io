<h3> Hassium One Hundred Eighteenth element of the Periodic Table </h3>

<B>
Hassium is an artificial chemical element, symbol Hs of atomic number 108 (108 protons and 108 electrons) and of atomic mass 269 u belonging to group 8 (8B) of the Periodic Classification of Elements. It is probably a solid at room temperature. It is not found in the earth's crust.
<HR>
Obtaining: <BR>

The Hassium element was synthesized by German researchers led by Peter Armbruster and Gottfried Münzenberg in the GSI (Gesellschaft für Schwerionenforschung) laboratory of the Darmstadt Institute Heavy Ion Research in 1984.
<HR>
"Hs-265" was synthesized by focusing on Pb-208 a beam of Fe-58 created in the Universal Linear Accelerator (UNIPLAC). This synthesis was later confirmed by Russian researchers in Dubna.
<HR> Properties: <BR>

The properties of hasium have not yet been determined due to its very rapid decay. Decay occurs with emission of alpha particles (helium atom nuclei) with a half-life of 2 milliseconds. Therefore, it is presumed to be a solid, transitional, metallic element of gray or silver white color with chemical properties similar to that of the osmium element.
<HR> Nomenclature: <BR>

Like elements 101 through 109, a controversy arose over the adoption of a name for this element. IUPAC has temporarily adopted the name unniloctium (symbol Uno). In 1994 the committee of the same organization recommended that the element be named hahnium, and in 1997 it was adopted internationally the name Hassium, Portuguese for Hassium, which persists to this day. The name of the element is derived from Hessen, region of Germany where it is located the GSI lab
Oxidation States / Compounds

No compounds of this element are known, but apparently it has a +4 oxidation state.
