 <h3> Ununtrium The One Hundred  Thirteenth Element of the Periodic Table </h3>

 </div> <div align = "left">

 <B> Ununtrium (temporary name, Latin one, one, three) or Eka-thallium (similar to thallium) is a synthetic chemical element of Uut temporary chemical symbol, atomic number 113 (113 protons and 113 electrons), probably of  atomic mass 284 u.  It belongs to group 13 of the periodic table.
 <HR>
 Discovered in early 2004 by a team of Russian and American scientists, it is a transuranic, probably a silver-colored solid.
 <HR>
 History: <BR>

 On February 1, 2004, the ununtrium and ununpentium were synthesized, as reported by a team of Russian scientists from Dubna ("Joint Institute for Nuclear Research") and the American Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.  This discovery is still waiting for confirmation.
 <HR>
    
 On September 28, 2004, a team of Japanese scientists declared that they were successful in obtaining this element.
 <HR>
 Ununtrium, from Latin "ununtrium" is a systematic, temporary name, indicated by IUPAC.  It cannot be found in nature, for in order to obtain it its structure has to be modified to arrive at an exact result.  The element is little used because it is almost unknown.
 <HR> Compounds: <BR>

 Ununtrium compounds are not yet known, as the element was only obtained in very small quantities and its radioactive disintegration time is too short to prepare its compounds.  Judging by its position in the periodic table, it is speculated that its properties are similar to those of thallium, an element just above the table.  From this angle, the ununtrium is supposed to form ions with nox +1 and +3, similar to Tl and, by the effect of the inert pair, its +1 oxidation state is even more stable than thallium.  Trivalent Uut is speculated to be a more energetic oxidant than T1 + 3.
