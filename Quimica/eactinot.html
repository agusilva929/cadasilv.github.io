<B>
Actinium (from the Greek "aktínos", light ray) is a chemical element of the symbol Ac, atomic number 89 (89 protons and 89 electrons) with atomic mass 227.0 u. At room temperature, actinium is in the solid state.
<HR>
It is one of the rare earths and gives its name to a group of internal transition metals called actinides. It belongs to group 3 of the periodic classification of the elements. It was discovered in 1899 by the French André-Louis Debierne. Its main applications in radiotherapy and as a source of neutrons.
<HR>
History: <BR>

Actinium (from the Greek "ακτις", "ακτινoς", light ray), was discovered in 1899 by the French chemist André-Louis Debierne who obtained it from pechblenda. In 1902 it was independently discovered by Friedrich Otto Giesel.
<HR>
Main Features:

It is a metallic, radioactive silver aspect. Due to its intense radioactivity it shines in the darkness with a bluish light. Ac-227 isotope, which is found in trace amounts in uranium minerals, is an emitter of alpha particles and beta particles with a semisintegration period of 21.773 years. One ton of uranium mineral contains about 0.1 grams of actinium. Its chemical behavior is very similar to other rare earths, particularly lanthanum.
<HR> Applications: <BR>

Its radioactivity is about 150 times that of radio, making it useful as a neutron source. Besides that. It has no significant industrial applications. Ac-225 is used in medicine to produce Bi-213 for radiotherapy.
<HR>
Abundance and obtaining: <BR>

Traces of actinium (Ac-227) are found in uranium minerals, but are obtained in small quantities (in the order of milligrams) by bombarding radio-226 with neutrons in nuclear reactors. The metal is obtained by reducing the lithium vapor actin fluoride to 1100-1300 ° C.
