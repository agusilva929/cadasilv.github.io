 <B>
 RoentgeniumPB, roentgeniumPE (named after Wilhelm Conrad Roentgen), initially called the unununium (from Latin one, one, one) and eka-gold (similar to gold) is a chemical element, symbol Rg (formerly Uuu), atomic number 111.  (111 protons and 111 electrons), with atomic mass [272] u, being one of the heaviest atoms.
 <HR>
 Main Features:

 It is a synthetic, transuranic, radioactive element, whose only known isotope has a half-life of around 15 milliseconds, decaying to meitnerium-268.  Due to its presence in group 11 of the periodic table is a transition metal, probably metallic and solid.
 <HR> History: <BR>

 Roentgenium was first synthesized at the "Gesellschaft für Schwerionenforschung" (GSI) in Darmstadt, Germany on December 8, 1994, by an international team led by Peter Armbruster and Sigurd Hofmann.  Few atoms of this element were created (all 272Rg) by fusing bismuth-209 with nickel-64 ions into a "linear accelerator" (bombarding bismuth with nickel).
 <HR>
 The name "Roentgen" was accepted as permanent on November 1, 2004 in honor of Wilhelm Conrad Roentgen.  Prior to this date, the element was known, under IUPAC recommendations, by the name "unununium", symbol "Uuu".  Some researches gave it the name "eka-gold", similar to the characteristics of gold.
 <HR>
 Roentgen is not present in nature.  If present, it would be a risk due to its hazardous radiation.
 <HR> Oxidation states / Compounds: <BR>

 No compounds of this element are known, but it has (presumably) +3 oxidation state.
