 <h3> Moscovium  One Hundred fifteenth element of the Periodic Table </h3>

 </div> <div align = "left">

 <B> Moscovium is a radioactive synthetic element about which little is known.  It is classified as metal and is expected to be solid at room temperature.  Decays rapidly in other elements, including nihonium.

 The element had already been designated ununpentium, a placeholder name that means one-one-five in Latin.  In November 2016, the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) approved the name moscovium for element 115.
 <ul> <li> Atomic Number: 115 </li>
 <li> Atomic Symbol: Mc </li>
 <li> Atomic Weight: [288] </li>
 <li> Melting Point: Unknown </li>
 <li> Boiling Point: Unknown </li> </ul>
 <h3> Discovery </h3>

 The Moscovium was discovered in 2003 and officially announced on February 2, 2004. It was created and announced by scientists from the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna, Russia, and scientists from the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in the United States.
 <h3> Properties </h3> <p>

 The Moscovium has four isotopes with known half-lives, the most stable being 289Mc, with a half-life of about 220 milliseconds.
 </p> <p>
 The atomic weight of artificial transuran elements is based on the longest lived isotope.  These atomic weights should be considered provisional since a new isotope with a longer half life could be produced in the future.  [See Periodic Table of Elements]
 </p> <h3> Fonts of moscovium
 </h3> <p>
 To make Muscovium, scientists in Russia and the United States bombarded Americium atoms with calcium ions on a cyclotron.  This produced four moscovium atoms.
 </p> <h3> Uses of moscovium </h3>

 Only a few atoms of moscovium have ever been made, and they are only used in scientific studies.  It is used to make nihonium.
