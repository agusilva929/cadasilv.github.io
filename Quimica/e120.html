Unbinilium, also known as eka-radium or simply element 120, is the hypothetical chemical element in the periodic table with the symbol Ubn and the atomic number 120. Unbinilium and Ubn are the name and systematic symbol of IUPAC until a permanent name is decided. . Wikipedia
Symbol: Ubn
Atomic Number: 120
Did you know: It was calculated that Z = 120 may, in fact, be the next magic number of protons instead of Z = 114 or 126. infogalactic.com.
All elements heavier than uranium are being researched and synthesized in laboratories around the world. Searches seek is by element
more stable and lasting. Thus, any theoretical information about them will be tested and confirmed at these laboratories, and any official confirmation will be welcomed and posted on the site with due acknowledgment. Thank you.
