In 1919 the German physicist and mathematician Theodor Franz Eduard Kaluza proposed a controversial theory, according to which the universe would consist not only three spatial dimensions. Likewise the Swedish Oskar Klein, he predicted at least one ball more, distinct from the other - width, height, length - by a circular set consisting of a tiny distance format.

The theory developed by these scientists already visualizes the presence of particles of opposite charges circulating in opposite directions - the negative, such as electrons go clockwise, while positive, as positrons, moving counter-clockwise. Some particles are stable with regard to this new dimension configuring a zero charge, in the case of neutrino.

This theoretical sketch still can not reconcile quantum mechanics, which works with the atomic sub-particles, and the theory of relativity of Einstein, which operates in wider spheres, for example, with stars and galaxies. Half a century later, however, comes a new theory that achieves this goal, to unite the two main pillars of modern physics.

Superstring theory, the result of the twentieth century, post the idea that the quark, the minimum particle found in subatomic layers is woven by superstring energy wires that vibrate to determine how it will be the nature of atomic nucleus to which they are connected, thus defining act as the particle that contains this vibrational energy. Thus it is possible to combine the mechanisms governing Einstein's theory and the laws of quantum mechanics.

Part by the scientific fact that there are actually 11 dimensions, three spatial nature, one of time and seven curved, which also incorporate atomic mass and electric charge, among other characteristics. These other areas would not be visible, as suggested by the scholars of this theory, by not capture the light, essential for us to see and know.

Human reality therefore unfolds is only in three dimensions to which humans have used because they only filter the luminary radiation necessary for our vision and understanding of the known universe. The other spheres are therefore parallel realities.

Investigations into the superstring began in the 60s, with the work of many physicists to its constitution as a scientific theory. The aim of this theoretical framework to explain everything, encompassing all physical phenomena, and thus definitively connect the theory of relativity and quantum physics in a single block of mathematical discipline.

Superstring theory would be put to the test in 2007, when it completed construction in Switzerland, the largest accelerator in the Planet particles, the Large Hadron Collider, which would test one of the key concepts of this new science, supersymmetry. The experience, so far, has not been met.
<BR> <HR>
According to this idea, for each subparticle studied, there is a counterpart to complete symmetrically. The other particle, yet not accessible to human knowledge, is supposed to be denser than conventional, so it requires more energy to produce. It is expected that the Swiss collider is powerful enough to create this subparticle and thus contribute to scientifically prove the theory of superstring.
